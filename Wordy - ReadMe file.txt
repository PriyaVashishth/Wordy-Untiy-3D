Initailly, the game is set up with a Gun in the bottom center of the screen and a Question Word shown at the top left corner of the screen. After a second, spheres with English letters inscribed on them come 
falling from the top. The aim of the player is to shoot the spheres with letters which make up the Question Word in any random order to earn 10 points for each correct letter. The player loses 2 points for hitting
every wrong letlter. Also, the player has to save the gun from colliding with the spheres falling directly on the gun. Whenever the player finds a sphere with a target letter, he shall rotate the Gun using the arrow
keys on the keyboard accordingly, and shoot using the left mouse-button. The game ends when either the player scores more than 70 points or when any hazard/sphere destroys the gun by falling on it.
